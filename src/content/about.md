# About

Hello, I'm Vitor, a Software Engineer at [Verve Group](https://verve.com/).  
I'm originally from São Paulo, Brazil, and now living in Berlin, Germany. I'm an alumnus of [FATEC Praia Grande](https://fatecpg.cps.sp.gov.br/) where I graduated in Information Technology for Business Management. 
I code as a hobby and like to create open-source projects for fun.

I love hiking, trekking, sports in general, and I've been working toward running a marathon, with some ups and downs.

I'm a native Brazilian Portuguese speaker, and I also speak English and Spanish.

I've been working in the **Ad Tech** industry since 2022.  
Here’s what I've been working with lately:

- Go
- Distributed Systems
- Google Cloud
- Redis and Valkey
- VictoriaMetrics
- Grafana
