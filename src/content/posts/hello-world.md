# Hello World

This is your first blog post. You can write **markdown** here.

- Edit this file in `src/content/posts/`
- Add new posts as `.md` files with frontmatter: `title`, `date`, optional `description`
- Use standard markdown: headers, lists, code, links, images

## Code example

```ts
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

Thanks for reading.
